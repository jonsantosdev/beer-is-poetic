Beer is Poetic

## Description

This website allows you to search for a brewery when you enter a city name and will generate a satellite image of the city as well as a random poem that has the word "beer", "ale", "saloon", and "tavern" in it and credits the author.

3 APIs were called:
    List of breweries by city
    https://api.openbrewerydb.org

    Satellite image of city
    https://api.nasa.gov/

    Random poems
    https://poetrydb.org/

Built on: 
    HTML 
    CSS 
    JS
Tailwinds for CSS library
    For the purposes of this project we were required to use the CDN interface (not recommended by Tailwind for live sites, just testing) and will use installation in future.
jQuery and jQueryUI
